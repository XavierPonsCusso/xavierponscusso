                        BLN is my first fanzine that showcases my passion for photography and experimenting with Artificial Intelligence. As a photographer, I captured a collection of images during my trip to Berlin and later transformed them by distorting and adding high contrast in post-production. However, I didn't stop there - I wanted to take this transformation concept further by passing the images through an Artificial Intelligence engine.

                    <div class="ESH3"> 
                        For this project, I used the software Diffusion Bee, which transforms text to image. The prompts given were just the original photo and a generic text prompt like "Underground culture Berlin". The objective of this exercise was not to achieve a realistic output but to create more abstract images with errors made by the AI.

                    <div class="ESH3"> 
                        The final result is a unique fanzine that presents a transformation from a transformation concept. Each spread features two opposed pages that are related through the AI engine. On the left pages of the publication, you'll find the original image previously edited with Photoshop and manually distorted, while on the right page, you'll find the output of the original image after being altered with Diffusion Bee.

                        BLN is more than just a publication - it's a creative exploration of the intersection between traditional techniques and emerging technologies. The fanzine has been well-received, and I'm proud to have it sold in good libraries such as Laie CCCB, FotoColetania and other local libraries in Barcelona.
