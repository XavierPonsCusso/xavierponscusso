                    Llobregat is a multidisciplinary project that explores the relationship between humans and technology. The project was tutorized by Ramón Faura, architect and professor at the Elisava Design School, and involved designers Mar Doreste, Martí Segura, Julia Perucho, Liam Kelly and me. The team spent 24 hours near the Llobregat river in Olesa de Montserrat, where they faced the challenge of building a shelter for five people without the use of any electronic devices or manual tools. To add an additional layer of complexity, we even left behind verbal communication, instead using sounds, signals, and dances to communicate and collaborate.

                    The team used locally-sourced materials, such as reeds, stones, and branches, to construct their shelter. They experimented with these materials to create basic household products, such as baskets, braids, and clothing, and reflected on the efficiency and sustainability of the materials used. During the process, the team also engaged in discussions about the nature of technology and communication. They questioned whether language itself can be considered a form of technology and explored the relationship between technology and nature.

                    The result of this immersive and challenging experience was a beautiful underground sign made from reeds, connecting the city to the Llobregat river. The sign represents the culmination of the team's journey, a physical manifestation of their reflections and explorations.

                    The Llobregat project showcases the power of collaboration, creativity, and experimentation in design. It challenges our preconceptions about the role of technology in our lives and highlights the importance of sustainability and mindful design practices.                 </div>
