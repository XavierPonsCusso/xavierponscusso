                        MUTE IS A PROJECT DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE NON-COMMUNICATION. IT CONSISTS OF FOUR WEARABLE DEVICES, EACH OF WHICH IS <span class="ESH7">DESIGNED TO MUTE A DIFFERENT FORM OF COMMUNICATION</span>. 
                        
                        <br><br>THE PROJECT WAS DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH MAR DORESTE, MARTÍ SEGURA, AND JULIA PERUCHO, UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF SAÚL BAEZA (DOES-WORK.COM). <br><br>THE PROJECT BEGAN WITH AN ABSTRACT BRIEFING THAT CHALLENGED THE TEAM TO FIND CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EDWARD SNOWDEN, ISABEL I DE CASTILLA, AND REI KAWAKUBO. THROUGH RESEARCH AND ITERATION, THE TEAM ARRIVED AT THE CONCEPT OF MUTING COMMUNICATION.

            <span class="ESH7">HOW</span> <br> <br>
            TO BRING THIS IDEA TO LIFE, FOUR WEARABLE PRODUCTS WERE DESIGNED THAT FOCUSED ON MUTING DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF COMMUNICATION.  <br> <br>
            
            THE FIRST PRODUCT CONSISTED OF <span class="ESH7">TWO WHITE CONTACT LENSES THAT CONCEALED THE IRIS</span>, EFFECTIVELY MUTING THE VISUAL LANGUAGE OF THE WEARER. 
         </div>
        
         

         <div class="ESH6">
            THE SECOND PRODUCT WAS <span class="ESH7">A CROWN-LIKE HEADPIECE MADE OF TRANSLUCENT PLASTIC THAT COVERED THE ENTIRE HEAD</span>, MUTING FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. THE THIRD PRODUCT WAS A <span class="ESH7">COSTUME WITH VELCRO ATTACHMENTS THAT BOUND THE WEARER'S ARMS TO THEIR BODY</span>, MUTING BODY LANGUAGE. FINALLY, THE FOURTH PRODUCT WAS A SET OF SUPPORTS THAT <span class="ESH7">ATTACHED SMOKE FLARES TO THE ARMS AND LEGS, COMPLETELY COVERING THE WEARER IN A SHROUD OF SMOKE</span> AND MUTING THEIR IDENTITY.                  
         </div>

         <div class="ESH6">
            DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE ATTEMPTS TO MUTE COMMUNICATION ONLY SEEMED TO AMPLIFY IT. TO ADDRESS THIS, THE APPROACH WAS REVERSED AND <span class="ESH7">THE CONCEPT WAS COMMUNICATED THROUGH A REAL RUNWAY SHOW</span> FEATURING THE WEARABLE DESIGNS. THE RESULT WAS A THOUGHT-PROVOKING AND VISUALLY STRIKING DISPLAY THAT CHALLENGED TRADITIONAL NOTIONS OF COMMUNICATION AND SELF-EXPRESSION.
