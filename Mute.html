                        Introducing "Mauna," a wearable device designed to explore the potential of wearable technology in promoting mindfulness and relaxation. Developed in collaboration with designer Mar Doreste and firmware engineer Joan Gomez, this project showcases my passion for creating innovative solutions that help people lead healthier and more mindful lives.

                    <div class="ESH3"> 
                        The device uses an Arduino Uno connected to multiple sensors, including an accelerometer that reads posture, another next to the eye that reads blinks, a textile sensor on the finger, and a heartbeat controller around the arm. These sensors work together to monitor the wearer's physical and emotional state, playing gentle sounds through the integrated speaker only when the user is relaxed and has good posture.                    
                    </div> <br>   

                    <div class="ESH3"> 
                        Each sensor triggers a unique sound output, with blinking producing a blink sound, the textile sensor producing a soft touch sound, and the heartbeat triggered by the heartbeat controller. Furthermore, if the user's posture is incorrect, the device vibrates to encourage them to sit up straight and disable the other sensors.

                        Creating this project was a challenge that involved hardware electronics, coding, and prototyping. It allowed me to push the boundaries of wearable technology and explore new possibilities in creating meaningful products.
