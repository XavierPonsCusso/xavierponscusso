                        Mute is a project that explores a unique design methodology in collaboration with Mar Doreste, Martí Segura, and Julia Perucho, under the guidance of Saúl Baeza from does-work.com. The project began with an abstract briefing, which challenged us to find connections between three seemingly unrelated figures: Edward Snowden, Isabel I of Castile, and Rei Kawakubo.

                        Through our methodology of <div class="ESH4">Analysing, Detecting, and Transforming, </div> we delved deeper into the characters and their stories. With each iteration, we found new meanings and associations that eventually led us to the concept of muting communication.

                    <div class="ESH3"> 
                        To bring this idea to life, we designed four wearable products that focused on muting different aspects of communication. The first product consisted of two white contact lenses that concealed the iris, effectively muting the visual language of the wearer. The second product was a crown-like headpiece made of translucent plastic that covered the entire head, muting facial expressions. The third product was a costume with Velcro attachments that bound the wearer's arms to their body, muting body language. Finally, the fourth product was a set of supports that attached smoke flares to the arms and legs, completely covering the wearer in a shroud of smoke and muting their identity.

                    <div class="ESH3"> 
                        During the development process, we discovered that our attempts to mute communication only seemed to amplify it. To address this, we decided to reverse our approach and communicate our concept through a real runway show featuring our wearable designs. The result was a thought-provoking and visually striking display that challenged traditional notions of communication and self-expression.
