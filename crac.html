                    Crac is a personal project born from form experimentation, inspired by Bruno Munari's experiments of form. Since 2021, I have been exploring the possibilities of recycled wine and beer glass bottles by cutting them and playing with shapes. <br><br>

                    The bottles themselves have a distinct shape, with varying diameters and heights, and typically feature a cylindrical form with a stable base that gradually narrows as it approaches the neck of the bottle. The neck often has a more progressive or straight shape, while the head of the bottle has a thicker glass profile and can be corked.

                    <br><br>
                                
                
                
                    This <div class="MeH2">form recycling project </div> has two different collections: Useful Crac and Useless Crac. <br><br>
                    
                    <div class="MeH2">Useful Crac </div>
                    features functional products such as cups, ashtrays, lamps, and vases. Simple and straightforward designs characterize the cups, which can be made in different diameters, heights, and colors. By cutting the bottom of the wine bottles and turning them upside down, we can create fancy ashtrays with different personalities depending on the bottle. This exercise can be extended to different types of lamps and vases, playing with the shape of the bottle neck.<br><br>
                  
                  
                    <div class="MeH2">Useless Crac</div>
                    is a collection of forms. All pieces are made with glass and, even though they come from different shaped bottles, they have a synergy that allows them to combine into coherent and great new form sculptures. This exercise is endless and forces us to explore new shapes by playing with different pieces, combining forms, and colors. It can be a great source of inspiration for expanding the boundaries of form for other projects.<br><br>
                 

                 
                    Photography is essential for bringing the project to life. It is especially important to capture good studio photographs of glass products to experiment with hard or soft lighting and reflectivity. By showcasing the forms in a photographic context, we can continue to explore the possibilities of glass recycling and form creation.
