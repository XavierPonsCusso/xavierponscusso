                  SUNDAYS IS AN <span class="LLH7">ANALOG PHOTOGRAPHY ENLARGER DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR UV LIGHT EMULSIONS</span>. IT USES THE POWER OF SUN RAYS TO PROJECT 35MM FILM ONTO CYANOTYPE OR VAN DYKE PAPERS, RESULTING UNIQUE PRINTS. 
                  
                  <br><br> WITH SUNDAYS, YOU CAN EXPLORE THE BEAUTY OF ANALOG PHOTOGRAPHY IN A SIMPLE AND INTUITIVE WAY. IT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE FULL RANGE OF THE UV LIGHT SPECTRUM FROM THE SUN, WITHOUT RELYING ON SUPER POWERFUL UV LEDS. <br><br>

                  THIS PROJECT WAS DEVELOPED AS MY FINAL DEGREE PROJECT AT ELISAVA.

          <div class="LLH6">
            <span class="LLH7">HOW</span> <br><br> 

            THE ENLARGER IS EQUIPPED WITH A <span class="LLH7">FRESNEL LENS</span> THAT CONVERGES ALL THE SUN RAYS ONTO THE EXACT FOCAL POINT OF THE<span class="LLH7"> 50MM PROJECTOR LENS</span>. BEFORE REACHING THE LENS, THE SUNLIGHT PASSES THROUGH THE 35MM FILM, AND FINALLY PROJECTS THE INVERSE IMAGE ONTO THE <span class="LLH7">PHOTOSENSITIVE PAPER</span>.
                          </div><br><br>    


          <div class="LLH6">
            DUE TO THE <span class="LLH7">HEAT CONCENTRATED BY THE INFRARED RAYS</span> OF THE SUN, THE FILM CAN BE EASILY BURNED. THAT'S WHY SUNDAYS INCLUDES AN IR BLOCKER FILTER TO PROTECT THE PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM. <br><br>

          THE SLIDING GUIDES OF THE ENLARGER ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW A GOOD FOCUS OF THE IMAGE AND ADJUST THE SIZE OF THE PROJECTION.  
                          </div><br><br>

                                    <div class="LLH6">
                                      THE EXPOSURE TIMES WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF EMULSION AND THE TIME OF DAY WHEN USING THE ENLARGER. <span class="LLH7">SUNNY MID-DAYS ARE THE BEST TIME FOR ENLARGING</span>, BUT THIS WILL DEPEND ON THE SPECIFIC SITUATION AND PREFERENCES.

    <span class="LLH7">INVESTIGATION</span> <br><br> 
    
    I UTILIZED A METHODOLOGY BASED ON THE <span class="LLH7">DETECTING, ANALYZING, AND TRANSFORMING</span> MODEL TO CONDUCT THREE IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATIONS. <br><br> 

  </div>
    <div class="LLH6">
    
    I EXPLORED WHICH PHOTOGRAPHY <span class="LLH7">TECHNIQUES WERE BEING LEFT BEHIND</span> AND WHY, EXAMINED THE CURRENT STATE OF <span class="LLH7">PHOTOGRAPHY IMPACT ON SOCIETY </span>WITH 4K DEFINITION CAMERAS IN OUR MOBILE PHONES, AND CONSIDERED WHAT <span class="LLH7">THE NEXT STEP IN ANALOG PHOTOGRAPHY </span>COULD BE FOR OUR SOCIETY.
                  </div><br><br>    


  <div class="LLH6">
    BASED ON THESE INSIGHTS, I WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE PHOTOGRAPHY PROCESSES THAT HAVE SENSE TO USE TODAY. PROPOSING A WAY TO <span class="LLH7">RECONNECT MODERN PHOTOGRAPHERS WITH THE ARTISAN STYLE OF ANALOG PHOTOGRAPHY WITHOUT USING TOXIC CHEMICALS.</span> <br><br>

    <span class="LLH7">PROTOTYPING</span> <br><br> 
    
    BEFORE FINALIZING THE MEASUREMENTS, MATERIALS, AND USABILITY OF THE ENLARGER, IT WAS IMPORTANT TO TEST ITS FUNCTIONALITY.  <br><br> 

  </div>

  <div class="LLH6">
    
    A PROTOTYPE WAS CREATED USING CARDBOARD AGILITY, WOOD PIECES, AND MOBILE JOINTS TO <span class="LLH7">EXPERIMENT AND DEFINE THE BEST TECHNICAL DETAILS</span> FOR THE FINAL PRODUCT.</div><br><br> 

    <div class="LLH6">
    
      THE GOAL OF THE PROTOTYPE WAS TO PROVIDE AN <span class="LLH7">ADJUSTABLE AND INTERACTIVE MODEL THAT ENABLED PLAY AND DISCOVERY</span>. THIS PROCESS ENSURED THAT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE ENLARGER WAS OPTIMIZED BEFORE FINALIZING ITS DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.

      <span class="LLH7">RESULTS</span> <br><br> 
      
      VAN DYKE PRINTS HAVE A GOLDEN BROWN TONE AND TAKE BETWEEN 2 AND 6 MINUTES OF EXPOSURE, WHILE CYANOTYPE IMAGES CAN TAKE AROUND 8 AND 15 MINUTES WITHOUT THE USE OF ANY CHEMICAL PRODUCT.  <br><br>

    <div class="LLH6">
      
      THE USE OF SUNDAYS HAS A LOT OF <span class="LLH7">DIFFERENT VARIABLES THAT CAN AFFECT THE FINAL RESULT</span>. THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION WHERE IT’S USED, THE SEASON OF THE YEAR, THE TIME OF DAY AND EVEN POLLUTION.
    
    </div><br><br> 
  
      <div class="LLH6">
      
        THIS CREATES UNIQUE RESULTS AND ENCOURAGES THE USER TO LEARN AND EXPERIMENT WITH UV LIGHT SENSITIVE PHOTOGRAPHY EMULSIONS, RECONNECTING PHOTOGRAPHERS WITH THE ARTISANAL PROCESS PHOTOGRAPHY USED TO BE.
